\subsubsection{ESP32 DevKit Microcontroller}

The ESP32 DevKit is a versatile, low-cost microcontroller (MCU) from Espressif Systems, widely used for embedded and IoT applications. 
It features a dual-core Xtensa 32-bit LX6 processor, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and multiple peripherals such as ADC, DAC, I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, and general-purpose GPIO pins. 
These capabilities make it suitable for real-time signal processing, motor control, and lightweight reinforcement learning.

In this project, the ESP32 DevKit serves as the primary controller, performing tasks such as real-time RSSI acquisition, servo motor control for directional antenna alignment, and execution of the reinforcement learning algorithm. 
The firmware is developed using the Arduino IDE for rapid prototyping.

\subsubsection{Project Capabilities}

The project is capable of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of a mechanically steerable directional antenna using servos or stepper motors controlled by a microcontroller (e.g., ESP32)
    \item Development of baseline alignment algorithms, including full angular scanning and RSSI-based hill-climbing methods, for performance comparison
    \item Integration of a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm to adapt antenna orientation based on observed RSSI trends
    \item Experimental evaluation of alignment performance in static and mildly dynamic environments, including convergence time, RSSI gain, link stability, and energy consumption
\end{itemize}

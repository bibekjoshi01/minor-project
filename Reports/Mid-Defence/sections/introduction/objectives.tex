\subsection{Objectives}

The objectives of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To design and implement a low-cost embedded system capable of measuring RSSI in real time and mechanically steering a directional antenna
    \item To develop and evaluate lightweight reinforcement learning-based alignment strategies, comparing their performance against baseline methods
\end{itemize}

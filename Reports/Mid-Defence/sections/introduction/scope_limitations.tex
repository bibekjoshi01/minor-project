\subsubsection{Project Limitations}

The scope of this project is subject to the following limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advanced multi-antenna architectures such as MIMO or phased-array systems are not considered.
    \item High-frequency millimeter-wave communication and complex beamforming techniques are outside the scope of this work
    \item The framework focuses on receiver-side alignment only and does not incorporate transmitter-side adaptation or coordinated alignment strategies
    \item Full mobility scenarios, including moving transmitters or high-speed vehicular environments, are not addressed
    \item The use of tabular Q-learning requires discrete state and action spaces, introducing approximation error and limiting scalability to continuous or high-dimensional alignment problems
    \item RSSI variability and the non-deterministic nature of wireless channels reduce experimental repeatability and measurement precision
\end{itemize}

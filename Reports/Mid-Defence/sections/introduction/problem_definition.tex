\subsection{Problem Definition}

The problem addressed in this project is the design of a receiver-side control mechanism that determines and continuously updates the orientation of a mechanically steerable directional antenna using only Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements. The system must operate in real time under dynamic and noisy wireless conditions while satisfying the computational, memory, and power constraints of low-cost embedded hardware

This project investigates whether tabular reinforcement learning can provide superior convergence speed and alignment stability under noisy conditions compared to conventional heuristic RSSI-based methods, such as exhaustive scanning and hill-climbing. Establishing this capability is critical for enabling reliable, low-cost, and autonomous antenna alignment on resource-constrained embedded platforms without reliance on advanced RF hardware or precise environmental models

\subsubsection{Project Applications}

The proposed system can be applied in the following domains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improving the reliability and range of fixed wireless links in rural or remote areas
    \item Enhancing signal stability in IoT and wireless sensor networks employing directional antennas
    \item Low-cost point-to-point wireless communication systems where manual antenna alignment is impractical
    \item Educational and research platforms for exploring embedded reinforcement learning applied to real-time RF control systems
\end{itemize}

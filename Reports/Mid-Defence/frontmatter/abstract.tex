Accurate alignment of directional antennas is essential for maintaining reliable
wireless communication links, particularly in low-cost and resource-constrained
systems where phased arrays and complex beamforming hardware are impractical.
This project presents the design and implementation of an autonomous antenna
alignment system that employs reinforcement learning to optimize the orientation of
a mechanically steerable directional antenna using real-time Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) feedback. The proposed system consists of a transmitter
and an intelligent receiver node equipped with an ESP32 microcontroller, a high-gain 2.4 GHz directional antenna, and a stepper motor for precise angular control. A
lightweight tabular Q-learning RL algorithm runs directly on the embedded
platform. System performance is evaluated against conventional baseline
approaches, including exhaustive angular scanning, and
RSSI-based hill-climbing methods. Evaluation results are quantified using formally
defined metrics such as convergence time, alignment accuracy, link stability,
mechanical efficiency, and robustness to environmental disturbances. Compared to
baseline methods, the proposed RL achieved faster convergence
and reduced motor actuation while maintaining stable link quality. This work
demonstrates the practical feasibility of embedded reinforcement learning for
autonomous antenna alignment in low-cost wireless systems.
